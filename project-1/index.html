                <p>Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
                    Is it that sweet? I guess so
                    Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
                    That's that me espresso
                    Move it up, down, left, right, oh
                    Switch it up like Nintendo
                    Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
                    That's that me espresso
                    I can't relate to desperation
                    My give-a-fucks are on vacation
                    And I got this one boy and he won't stop callin'
                    When they act this way, I know I got 'em
                    Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
                    Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
                    Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
                    (Yes) I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
                    (Yes) that morning coffee, brewed it for ya
                    (Yes) one touch and I brand-newed it for ya (oh)
                    Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
                    Is it that sweet? I guess so

                    That's that me espresso
                    Holy shit
                    Is it that sweet? I guess so
                    I'm working late, 'cause I'm a singer
                    Oh, he looks so cute wrapped 'round my finger
                    My twisted humor make him laugh so often
                    My honey bee, come and get this pollen
                    Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
                    Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
                    Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
                    (Yes) I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
                    (Yes) that morning coffee, brewed it for ya
                    (Yes) one touch and I brand-newed it for ya (stupid)
                    Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
                    Is it that sweet? I guess so
                    Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
                    That's that me espresso
                    Move it up, down, left, right, oh
